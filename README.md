# COVAXID

## Overview
The COVAXID clinical trial was launched at Karolinska University Hospital to address the knowledge gap concerning immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in individuals with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. While these patients were excluded from initial clinical trials, leading to scarce safety and efficacy data, they are classified as high-risk groups and were therefore prioritized for vaccination. The COVAXID trial encompasses 539 participants, all vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. The 539 patients were grouped into 5 immunodeficiency groups and 1 health control group. The immunodeficient groups were: 1) Primary Immunodeficiencies, 2) People living with HIV, 3) Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplanted (or CAR-T treated) individuals, 4) Solid Organ Transplanted individuals and 5) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients. Initially slated to conclude six months post-second dose, the study has been extended twice due to evolving pandemic conditions, updated booster dose guidelines, and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is now anticipated to wrap up in April 2024.

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for all projects associated with the COVAXID Clinical Trial (EudraCT: 021-000175-37, clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04780659). It houses essential documentation, database schema, data analysis code, and figure-reproduction scripts pertinent to published studies. The repository aims to be a centralized hub for projects utilizing data from the COVAXID trial. Collaborators on COVAXID-related initiatives are encouraged to contribute relevant materials to this repository.
